# Pokémon API Application
 
The application uses [Pokémon API](https://pokeapi.co/) to get data about pokémon, items, and locations.

## Technical stack 

During the development process, I have used ``React``, ``React-Router``, ``Fetch API``, and ``Bootstrap`` as the basic tools.

**Usage of ``React`` in the project:**
* Component lifecycle methods (``componentDidMount``, ``componentDidUpdate``);
* Render functions;
* ``Props.children``;
* Transforming elements with ``React.Children`` and ``React.cloneElement()``;
* Higher-Order Components (HOC) and HOC composition;
* Transferring the data within ``Context API``;
* HOC + ``Context`` in React.

**Usage of ``React-Router`` in the project:**
* ``BrowseRouter``, ``Route``, ``Switch``, ``Link``, ``Redirect``, ``withRouter``;
* Relative path, optional parameters.

<hr>

The application was created to solidify the knowledge of React and allied technologies for User Interface development. 

It shows the understanding of basic tools and their implementation within a specific project.

## Follow the next steps to launch the app 
1. Git clone the repository to your local machine;
2. Run the ``npm start`` command in console to build and view in the browser.
